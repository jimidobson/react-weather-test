It took me about a day to make this, not including time I spent refreshing my knowledge with a React Udemy course.

Things I'd improve:

- Styling. I'm still getting to grips with CSS and how HTML is laid out so there are styling issues with things not quite aligned, plus a big white screen before you load the data.

- Loading message. This is added directly depending on the loading state/if data has been fetched. I feel it should instead be configured using state, like a string property that is updated according to the loading status for example.

- Layout of the data. I wanted to have the data organised by 24-hour day objects laid out horizontally that would then be filled with whatever data was available for that day, laid out vertically beneath its day. I ran out of time before I could figure out how to organise the data this way but I created components to achieve this effect.

- Error handling. Currently doesn;t gracefully handle issues with fetching data, or the possibility of data not matching what the app expects.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
